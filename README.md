Rebecca's Fishing Tracker

Live site: https://rcoras.github.io/fishing_log_client/

Github repo:

This is a tool to allow fishermen to log details of their fishing trips. A user is able to create an account. Once they create an account they can sign in to keep track of their stats. They can add a trip, update a trip, delete a trip, and see details of their entire list of trips or one particular trip.

The site was built using:

HTML,
CSS,
Javascript,
Jquery,
Json,
Ajax

I created user stories and built out a wireframe inorder to help guide me as I built out my fishing tracker. I started with the idea to build one resource linked to the users and hope to expand to create another table that will store more data for each trip.

Here are the user stories I started with:


The backend was also built by me as well. You can see the github repo here:
